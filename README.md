# THE SOLID PRINCIPLES

## 1.Single responsibility principle

  A class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have a single, well-defined responsibility. That class should entirely encapsulate responsibility.

## 2.Open/closed principle

  Software entities (classes, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to add new functionality to a class without changing its existing code, but you should not need to modify the class itself to do so.

## 3.Liskov substitution principle

  Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. In other words, if a class is derived from another class, you should be able to use the derived class in the same way as the base class without any issues.

## 4.Interface segregation principle

  Clients should not depend on interfaces they do not use. This means you should design your interfaces as specific and focused as possible.

## 5.Dependency inversion principle

  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Design your software so high-level modules depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
